# excel-bike-project

### Introduction
I created the excel-bike-project, a data analysis project using Microsoft Excel. My goal was to analyze bike sales data and create a live dashboard for visualizing the insights.

### Data Cleaning
I started by cleaning the data, removing duplicates, and filling in missing values. This ensured the reliability and accuracy of the data for further analysis.

### Data Analysis
Once the data was cleaned, I used Excel's features and functions to analyze the bike sales data. I created a pivot table to summarize the data and gain key metrics such as total sales, average sales, and sales by product category or region.

### Data Visualization
To present the data effectively, I utilized Excel's charting capabilities. I created various visualizations, including bar charts and line charts, to identify trends and patterns within the bike sales data.

### Interactive Filters
To enhance the user experience, I implemented interactive filters in the Excel dashboard. These filters allowed users to slice and dice the data dynamically based on different dimensions such as product category, region, or time period.

### Raw Data Preservation
To ensure the safety of the raw data, I created a working sheet as a secure repository. This allowed me to preserve the original data in its unaltered form and provided a backup in case of any issues during the analysis and visualization process.

### Conclusion
The excel-bike-project demonstrated the power of Microsoft Excel in analyzing and visualizing bike sales data. Through data cleaning, analysis, and visualization, I gained valuable insights into sales trends and created an interactive dashboard. This project highlighted the importance of data-driven decision-making based on meaningful insights extracted from the data.
